background pages are updated to service workers.
service workers donot run continuosly, so no longer we can get the elapsed
timer using setInterval.

fix: service workers will run when any even occurs, so what we do?
fire event at every second, how ? create alarm for each second and then
at each second we can get the time elapsed, from service worker.
